# Adaptive Validation

This repository contains example code for the adaptive validation substudy design, which uses the framework of Bayesian monitoring methods to estimate classification parameters (sensitivity and specificity, or positive and negtive predictive values) for validation data that are collected prospectively. This validation substudy design can be carried out within the context of any parent epidemiologic study, such as cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. The example R code contained herein illustrates how to implement this design for prospectively collected validation data. 

As this repository is in its early stages, we have only provided example code. However, we plan to include a simulated dataset with corresponding code, an R package, and ShinyApp... hopefully in the near future!
